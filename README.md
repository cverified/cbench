Here is a challenge for people who are interested in practical C program verification using formal methods.  Show us how to verify the correctness of the twenty-five programs in the paper [A benchmark for C program verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01009).

If you are interested in this in any way, feel free to send me mail (and preferably verification proofs of these programs) at freek@cs.ru.nl.
